		<h4 class="title">About The Game</h4>
		<p>Welcome to..... <em>Food Attack!</em> This game consist of our favorite junk foods, snacks, and tasty treats coming to life and looking to take a bite out of <strong>YOU!</strong>. You are a normal Joe Schomo chilling on your couch on a firday evening. Just finished drinking a brewsky when out of the corner of your eye you spot a joint sitting on your living room table. Your buddy slim Jim must have left one behind. You then light it up as you lay down on your comfy second hand couch. You soon realize that the joint had a funny taste and whatever you just inhaled was a first for you. The room starts to spin and you become more and more sweaty as you feel your body entering uncahrted waters. Out of nowhere you snap! and BAM! Your living room seems to be glowing in a different way and everything has shadows of colors following them. As you reach for your bag of chips to get the weird taste out of your mouth, you start to hear some whispering from the bag. The chips then peak out of the bag and begin screaming as your hand gets closer. That's when you realize the house is full of talking foods and whatever was not weed! You need to somehow fight off the rebelious foods with gun you have on your living room table!
